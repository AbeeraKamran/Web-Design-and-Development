She received her PhD from the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation (GSAPP), Columbia University. She is the author of Infrastructure Redux: Crisis, Progress in Industrial Pakistan & Beyond (2015, Palgrave Macmillan), which explores, through detailed cases of Sialkot and Faisalabad in industrializing Punjab, the double-edged narratives of development that frame infrastructure in post-independence Pakistan. Nausheen is the recipient of several grants that center on themes such as gender and inequality, conflict resolution and urban governance, migration, and political-economy of infrastructure development.<span class="hide-for-small-only">Her current project examines shifting registers of mobility, infrastructures and political authority that mediate everyday life in a constellation of cities and towns that connect the border regions of Iran and Pakistan. Aspects of Nausheen’s work also appear in the journals Antipode, Environment and Planning A, and South Asian History and Culture. She has held post-doctoral fellowships at Harvard University and at the Asia Research Institute (ARI), National University Singapore.</span></p>

His research is on eighteenth and nineteenth century narrative traditions of geography in Sindh and South Asia. He is wildly curious about how people in Sindh imagined the world and their region at a time when British geographic and colonial constructs of continents and ethnolinguistic regions did not frame their spatial thinking. He is currently poring over manuscripts in archives in search of answers. When he is not at the library or in the archives, he is inevitably found having chai with family and friends.</p>
