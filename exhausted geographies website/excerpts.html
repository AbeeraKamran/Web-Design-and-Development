                		<p>"Given there is much disquiet in Karachi surrounding issues of land, securitization and inequality, this anxiety is writ large over the city's political-economic landscape. For this reason, cartographic representations are particularly revealing not only in terms of the political-economic production of urban space but also how these representations advance an idea of postcolonial utopia/dystopia. Simultaneously, for those who live in the city, maps attempt to showcase space as a bounded project where the micropolitics of violence and citizenship coalesce. As prominent signifiers of the unruly city, maps make the question of survival and politics particularly acute...""</p>

                	<div class="excerpt-overlay">
                		<p>"Understanding Karachi's past geographies of exclusion and displacement offers insight into the contemporary restructuring of the city. The numerous multiplexes, malls and bypasses that are sprouting on Karachi's cityscape today come with eerily familiar slogans of a 'modern city' or 'world class developmen.' Unsurprisingly enough, these mega-projects also continue to rely on authoritarian strategies of exclusion in order to appropriate and usurp land for the creation of elite, securitised spaces. The bars from Ayub Khan's Decade of Displacement may not have survived, but the desire to violently mould the city according to elite fantasies remains alive and well. Its costs on the poor remain untallied."</p>

                		<p>"The map I carried with me, which I had initially intended as a tool to navigate the quarter as well as a prescription for making sense of life in the quarter by marking land-use functions, soon lost its value as a visual representation to the social. It became instead a way to imagine another kind of space that represented to me, in a very subjective way, what was significant and gave meaning to life in the lived space of the quarter."</p>
