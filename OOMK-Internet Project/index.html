            <p>The Kingdom of Ice, the bottomest part of the world</p>
            <p>Antarctica. This is Antarctica!</p>
            <p>Cold shelter for the shattered. No sorrow here, tears freeze</p>
            <p>Antartica, antartica, oh boy oh boy LOOK at this, I..Wow, I must've really snapped the tether, huh?</p>
            <p>Apparently...</p>
            <p>That's great. I want to stay here forever. Set up camp. Build things. Build a city, an enormous city made up of frontier forts, dark wood and green roofs and high gates made of pointed logs and bonfires burning on every street corner, I should build by a river. Where are the forests?</p>
            <p>No timber here. Too cold. Ice, no trees.</p>
            <p>Oh details! I'm sick of details! I'll plant them and grow them, Ill live off caribou fat, Ill melt it over the bonfires and drink it from long, curved goat-horn cups. It'll be great. I want to make a new wolrd here. So that I never have to go home again.</p>
            <p>As long as it lasts. Ice has a way of melting...</p>
            <p>No. Forever. I can have anything I want here-maybe even companionship, someone who has...desire for me. You, maybe.</p>
            <p>It's against the by-laws of the International Order of Travel Agents to get involved with clients. Rules are rules. Anyway, Im not the one you really want.</p>
            <p>There isn't anyone...maybe an Eskimo. Who could ice-fish for food. And help me build a nest for when the baby comes.</p>
            <p>There are no Eskimos in Antartica. And you're not really pregnant. You just made that up.</p>
            <p>Well all this is made up. So if the snow feels cold I'm pregant. Right? Here, I can be pregnant. And I can have any kind of baby I want.</p>
            <p>This is a retreat, a vacuum, it's a virtue is that it lacks everything; deep-freeze for feelings. You can be numb and safe here, that's what you canme for. Respect the delicate ecology of your delusions.</p>
            <p>You mean like no Eskimo in Antarctica.</p>
            <p>Correcto. Ice and snow, no Eskimo. Even hallucinations have laws.</p>
            <p>Well, then who's that?</p>
            <p>An Eskimo.</p>
            <p>That's an antartic Eskimo. A fisher of the polar deep.</p>
            <p>There's something wrong with this picture.</p>
            <p>I'm going to like this place. It's my own National Geographic special! Oh! Oh!...I think I felt her kicking. Maybe I'll give birth to a baby covered with thick white fur, and that way she won't be cold. My breasts will be full of hot cocoa so she doesnt get chilly. And if it gets really cold, she'll have a pouch I can crawl into. Like a marsupial. We'll mend together. That's what we'll do; we'll mend.</p>
