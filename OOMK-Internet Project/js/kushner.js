Build things. Build a 🏙, an enormous 🏙 made up of frontier forts,dark wood and green roofs and high gates made of pointed logs and 🔥 burning on every street corner, I should build by a 💦. Where are the forests? No timber here. Too cold. ❄️, no 🌲. Oh details Im sick of details Ill plant them and 🌱 them, Ill live off caribou fat, Ill melt it over the 🔥 and drink it from long, curved goat-horn cups. Itll be great. I want to make a new 🌏 here. So that I never have to go home again. As long as it lasts. ❄️ has a way of melting...No. ∞. I can have anything I want here-maybe even 👩‍❤️‍👩, someone who has...desire for me. You, maybe. Its against the by-laws of the International Order of Travel Agents to get involved with clients. Rules are rules. Anyway, Im not the one you really want. There isnt anyone...maybe an Eskimo. Who could 🎣 for food. And help me build a nest for when the 👶 comes. There are no Eskimos in Antartica. And youre not really pregnant. You just made that up.Well all this is made up. So if the 🌨 feels cold Im pregnant. Right? Here, I can be pregnant. And I can have any kind of 👶🏾 I want. This is a retreat, a vacuum, its a virtue is that it lacks everything; deep-freeze for feelings. You can be numb and safe here, that is what you came for.');
