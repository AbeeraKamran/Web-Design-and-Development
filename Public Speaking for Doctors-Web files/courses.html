                    <h2>WHY DO THE COURSE</h2>
                    <p>The healthcare industry is dynamic and ever changing, and the National Health Service (NHS) needs innovative medical leaders who can manage organisational change. Clearly communicating your vision is critical to becoming a successful healthcare leader and being valued in your role as a clinician. Our bespoke courses will equip you with the tools you need to be taken seriously when you present at meetings, conferences, or teaching sessions.
                    </p>
               
                    <h2>WHAT WILL I LEARN</h2>
                    <p>The aim of the one day course is to enable you to communicate with confidence and clarity with your audiences. We will teach you about how to plan your presentations, deliver your pitch, and what communication techniques can be used in persuading your audience. We will also cover soft skills such as voice, posture, and body language that good speakers use to deliver their presentation. Topics we will cover through the day will include:</p>
                        <ul class="learning-points">
                            <li>Planning your pitch</li>
                            <li>Overcoming nerves</li>
                            <li>Creating presence</li>
                            <li>Captivating your audience</li>
                            <li>Body language</li>
                            <li>Handling awkward questions</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>WHO IS THE COURSE FOR</h2>
                    <p>Although the course will be most beneficial those who have regular responsibilities in presenting and speaking, it can also be useful for those who are preparing to take on roles that will require doing so. Nearly all doctors do some kind of public speaking, and our bespoke courses can be tailored to address a broad range of needs.</p>

                    <h2>HOW IS THE COURSE RUN</h2>
                    <p>Our one day public speaking courses are run as intense workshops that will give you a working understanding of the principle skills of a good public speaker. This will be reinforced with practical exercises to use some these skills in a relaxed environment. Access to online training materials will be provided as a reference for delegates.</p>

                    <h2>WHO RUNS THE COURSE</h2>
                    <p>Our courses are run by trainers who have years of professional experience in public speaking and executive skills coaching. Clients of some of our trainers have included 
                    MacMillan Cancer Support, Dell, and Imperial College London.</p>
