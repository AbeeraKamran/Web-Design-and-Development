              <p>Pahwaro Jabal is the name of the mountain in the Karachi township of Gadap which spanned over 3000 acres.</p>
              <p>"Before Bahria town, when rain frequented, pahwaro jabal was no less than Kashmir for us. You would see thousands of livestock roaming the mountain. There were many tallas/reservoirs, after the rains they would retain water for months. My grandfather also built a talla on pahwaro, this was the most famous of all, known as savesar." – Deen Mohammad</p>
              <p>Its name is made of two Sindhi words. Pah means musibat, struggle, and waro means wale. When Sassui crossed from here in search of Punnhu on this mountain she had to face many difficulties, which is why it came to be called Pahwaro.</p>
              <p>This web installation projects a work-in-progress – a web-based archive emerging from 6 months of research carried out in Gadap facilitated by Karachi Art Anti-University. The browser-based artworks attempt to grapple with the ongoing struggles around development, climate change and the marginalisation of indigenous peoples, knowledges and histories in Karachi – as well as the struggles, the possibilities and limitations of solidarity, research and representation.</p>
              <p>With content from Abdul Karim Gabol, Basil Andrews, Din Mohammad, Faiz Mohammad Gabol, Kanda Khan, Mah Bibi, Nawaz Ali Baloch, Reem Khurshid and Sarah Kazmi.</p>
              <p>This data was gathered collectively by participants of Karachi Art Anti-University’s Gadap Sessions, 2016. This course was organized in collaboration with Karachi Indigenous Rights Alliance, Gul Hassan Kalmatti and Nawaz Ali Baloch.</p>
