                    <h3>The Library Was</h3>
                    <p class="tag"> OOMK (2016)<br>
                    Published by Book Works</p>
                    <p>The Library Was sees OOMK reimagining the function, aesthetic and user culture of the library. Opening in an austerity-stricken future in which all public libraries have closed, it goes on to assert the continued importance of libraries via interviews with London-based library enthusiasts, a profile of the revolutionary Cuban librarian Marta Terry González, a re-assessment of The Five Laws of Library Science, 1931, as they do and don't apply to the collection of contemporary zines, and an account of the stolen library of the late Saudi novelist Abd al-Rahman Munif. It also documents the publications donated to the Open School East Library during OOMK‘s Future Library Fair held in December 2015, and describes the work of a semi-fictional group of readers and activists, who have pooled their resources to establish The Library of Aimless Yet Meaningful Pursuit, a space for meeting and learning outside of the algorithmic ‘Grid’.</p>

                    <p class="tag">Published by OOMK (2016)</p>
                    <p>In summer 2016 we teamed up with Kuala Lumpur based Odd One Out Magazine to research independent publishing practices in Malaysia. We met many artists, magazine makers and galleries at the forefront of self publishing in KL, Ipoh and Penang to get a better understanding of self publishing practices outside of London. We've spent the last few months transcribing the interviews, scanning the publications we collected and putting together a petty unique publication about our research. Supported by Arts Council England and the British Council.</p>
