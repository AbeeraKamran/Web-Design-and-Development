Through these projections we read, inscribe, understand and imagine ourselves, our communities, our histories and futures into the city’s surfaces and crevices. In these projections, our infinite and divergent realities within the same spatiality are realised. The city transforms under the gaze of its inhabitants-the fixed materialities of its architecture rendered elastic.</p>
	                            	<p>Drawing on these everyday practices, artists, curators and creative practitioners will enact their own ephemeral projections in the city. The projections will take the form of luminous moving imagery, urban transference, performance of desires, evocation of memories, and playful engagements with architectural forms, spatial configurations and experiential modes. And through these intersecting projections we ask how we can momentarily inhabit each other’s imagination-each other’s city?</p>

'Funland' is a multichannel video installation which has been produced with the support of the 8th Berlin Biennale and the DAAD Kunstler Programme.</p>
                                        <p>The 6 videos in this work meander between being memorials to a cosmopolitan city that fights for its survival to melancholic imaginings of a hypothetical, deserted future. The Karachi iteration of 'Funland' around the streets of the historic Saddar Bazaar, is a unique one, as the work engages physically and literally with the very nerve that runs through the entire work.</p>

                                        <p>The role of urban decay has had a strong influence on my research. Living in a city like Karachi, we are surrounded by marks, smears and erosion everywhere. These subconsciously formed visuals are part of a vicious cycle that contribute towards the bigger picture of our city. Overtime, people have tried to get rid of these marks, fix them…but in my videos and images I work with their appearance and disappearance, commenting on the endlessness of the process.</p>

                                        <p>Growing up in Karachi – the city of migrants – we have heard many stories of madness and mayhem that define our memories of Partition. In these stories, violence is always imagined elsewhere. Karachi is simply the ever-accommodating city that welcomes muhajirs with open arms. In the ruins of memory is a performance that takes place in Ratan Talao, a muhajir neighbourhood of Karachi. It returns to 1947 to reinsert memories and histories of violence and uprooting that lay buried at the heart of the neighbourhood.</p>

                                        <p>Near and far sights/ sites converge was shot through a homemade telescope at Manora beach on a monsoon afternoon in 2014. A circular space was glimpsed, a war ship from the Pakistan Navy fleet, figures amongst the waves in abandonment and freedom. This sense of intimacy and freedom in a public space is shrinking, like the sea itself.</p>
                                        <p>Manora is a restful anchor for the turbulence of Karachi, a space for non-elite leisure. Crossing the harbour on public taxi boats, visitors come to experience the expanse of horizon, a sight they often miss within the dense, congested spaces of the inner city.</p>
                                        <p>Working simultaneously in two disparate yet intrinsically connected landscapes within the city of Karachi gives me a sense of the malleability of the urban space. Projecting this video within the dense labyrinth of galis in Golimar was like an inversion of both spaces/spheres. It was like reaching through the lens of the doorbeen, pulling the ocean inwards, and bringing the horizon line into the dense mohalla.</p>

                                        <h3 class="modalTitle">Dispatches from the Edge/End of the World</h3>
                                        <p>Lyari Express Way</p>
                                        <p>Dispatches from the Edge/ End of the World was projected in what appeared to be an oasis of landfill that lay hidden underneath the network of Lyari Expressway’s smoothly constructed concrete and asphalt structures.  The monumental highway barriers form a periphery around the makeshift neighborhood.</p>
                                        <p>Families from various ethnicities that were forcefully evicted because of the construction of this highway now nestle themselves in makeshift homes dotted along the skinny Lyari river. The supine angles of the concrete monsters that cut across the night sky meet mines of garbage sourced from the entire city, laying claim to this dystopic landscape as No Man’s Land.</p>
                                        <p>Dispatches from the Edge/ End of the World is a jilted narrative of a lonesome plastic palm tree against the urban landscape of a what appears to be a ubiquitous construction site. Like psychograms transferred to a physical state, the clicks, hisses, gurgling and screeching voices that accompany the video metamorphose into decelerated moving images.</p>
                                        <p>Dispatches from the Edge/ End of the World explores the notion of progress and technology as a time-warping device, offering in the present time an event, experience or object that belongs to the past. The idea of the ghost (something present in absence) haunts, and obsolete (or ‘retro’) technology is employed to represent this rupture in time.</p>
                                        <p>Tracing the word record back to its Latin root recordari, we understand that recordings are always imbued with a function of remembrance, intended to allow that which has passed to be again. This function was perhaps more present in the minds of the early pioneers of sound recording technologies and describes not only the past of all recording formats but also their future. It is a future haunted by the spectre of death, of an object or event that is no longer, but which is the recording's capacity and function to make present again.</p>

                                        <p>mages of individual missing persons projected at the sites from which they were disappeared. Research and images for this series of projections were derived from various online databases and archives documenting state enforced disappearances specifically in relation to the Baloch community.</p>
                                        <p>In the struggle to recover missing persons and uncover the circumstances of their disappearance, the photograph of a missing person becomes key evidence as a 'certificate of presence' [1]. These images circulate widely in various forms across various dimensions; as posters in press club protests, framed photographs carried on foot from Quetta to Islamabad, MMS attachments circulating through cell phones, 10th generation jpegs, cropped and pixelated, screenshots and thumbnails, stored and shared on social media, blogs, websites and online archives; the degrading visual surface of each image bearing traces, a second layer of evidence, of the conditions of its production and circulation. Visible, in its incoherence, the struggle of the image to be preserved, to persevere. Evidence of the struggle, the refusal to disappear, to be disappeared.</p>
                                        <p>Mapping these moments of disappearance back onto the city, these projections aim to create ephemeral memorial landscapes to the missing at the site of the disappearance. To see, in fleeting moments, the city through its absences.

Its hazy image reaches a gridded façade under construction, grazes the uneven surface of decaying masonry, re-appears as a faint specter in the real estate mundi of Bahria town properties. Submerged by speculating dealers. Files, forms, foam, dust, near-prime investment options.  Waiting. Longing.</p>
